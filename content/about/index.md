## Matthew Evans 
### I am a 25+ year industry veteran with a knack for architecting creative, scalable, and secure on-prem or cloud solutions.  


I'm currently employed by a [Prometheus Alternative Investments](https://prometheusalts.com/), managing the cloud and security team. Previously, I was responsible for launching and securing a [$200 billion AUM hybrid-cloud SaaS platform](https://www.alphatheory.com/) & a [$500 million AUM hedge fund](https://centerbook.com/). I managed the global HQ infrastructure and security team for [HondaJet](https://www.hondajet.com/) through [first-flight](https://global.honda/newsroom/worldnews/2010/c101221FAA-Conforming-HondaJet.html) (i'm at 3:48 in the video), and I volunteer my free time on privacy projects such as [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/). There are a couple kids, a dog, and a pretty amazing wife I have no idea how I landed in there too.
